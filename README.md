# Gherkin Test Suite for UK Auto-Enrolment

### Background

The UK's Auto-enrolment regime is part of UK employees' rights and relates to the provision of workplace pensions a by UK employers.  All UK employers have a set of duties under the Pensions Acts 2008 and 2011 to enrol their workers into a "qualifying" workplace pension scheme, subject to age and earnings criteria.

When developing software implementations for Auto-enrolment, given that the regulations are reasonably precise, it seems sensible to encode the testing of the various scenarios in a standardised form.  The [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference) test
specification language provides an effective framework to do this.
